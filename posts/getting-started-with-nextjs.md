excerpt : Next.js is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".[4] Traditional React apps render all their content in the client-side browser, Next.js is used to extend this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side.
