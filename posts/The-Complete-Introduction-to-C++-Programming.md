**What is this course about?**.

The way this course have been structured and created is made to really help you learn and understand all the basics of this programming language. From the starting point where you will be installing the right tools and writing you first basic lines of code to the more advanced such as functions, statements, loops and many pratical projects, this course has everything you need to start programming in C++ and begin your programmation journey. Also, this course has been created to help you learn all the basics concepts that are the core of C++ programmation. This way, you will not only program in this language but you will also understand the logic behind this programming language and will be able to create various applications in it on your own. Indeed, if you don't have prior programming experience, the hardest part is understanding the programming logic and this course covers all the topics to help you succed in C++ programming.

Also, this course is built around a very simple but effective logic that is learning by practice. In other words, this course is definely not theoritical even if it contains some theoritical concepts. Indeed, this course is build on a logic of learning by practice. In other words, you will find various C++ exercices all over the course to help you master this programming language and achieve your end goal of learning how to program is C++.## see validation
