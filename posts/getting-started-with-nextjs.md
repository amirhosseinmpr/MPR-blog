NextJS is a **(The Course Has been Optimized and now includes also Git and GitHub Premium Lectures)**.
So you want to learn Version Control Systems.

Maybe that's Git, GitHub (or maybe both Git GitHub), GitLab, or even Bit Buckets. Doesn't really matter.

Let me teach you all the FUNDAMENTALS you need to get yourself STARTED as FAST as possible.

I know that your time is precious and maybe you're about to start a NEW JOB at your dream company or maybe you need to start working on your projects right away - so LET'S NOT WASTE TIME!

Studying our Git and GitHub Masterclass course will save you PLENTY of time googling and trying to connect the dots.

- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More
